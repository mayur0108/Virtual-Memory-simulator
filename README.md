# Virtual Memory Simulator

## Overview
The Virtual Memory Simulator is a Python-based tool designed for simulating and evaluating various page replacement algorithms in the context of virtual memory management in operating systems. This simulator provides a detailed analysis of FIFO, LRU, Clock, and Aging algorithms, offering a platform to compare their efficiency based on key performance metrics like page fault rate, hit ratio, and throughput.

## Installation
To install and run the simulator, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd [project directory]`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the simulator: `python main.py`

## Usage
The simulator provides a Command-Line Interface (CLI) for user interaction. Users can select different page replacement algorithms, simulate memory accesses, and view real-time updates of memory states and performance metrics.

## Features
- Simulates FIFO, LRU, Clock, and Aging page replacement algorithms.
- Modular and extensible design for easy integration of additional algorithms.
- Detailed performance metrics analysis for comparative evaluation.
- User-friendly CLI for interactive simulation and analysis.
